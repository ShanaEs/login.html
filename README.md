# login.html with main.css

Thank you for your interest in my form pages!

This is a non-responsive static web page (my first!).

There are a few transitions added.

Only HTML & CSS.




#create-account.html with account.css

Is a responsive static page created in connection to the original static non-responsive page.  Tested in both orientations and format sizes.

Only in HTML & CSS.
